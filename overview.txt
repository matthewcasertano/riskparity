RISK PARITY METHODOLOGY
Parameters:

Window: 60 trading days
Target volatility: 10% annualized
Financing: RF rate + 1% spread
RF source: Fama-French monthly data, converted to daily by dividing by 21, forward-filled

Three-Step Weight Calculation:
Step 1: Inverse Volatility Base Weights

For each asset, calculate 60-day rolling standard deviation
Annualize: std × sqrt(252)
Invert: 1/vol
Normalize so weights sum to 1.0

Step 2: True Portfolio Volatility Using Covariance

For each date t, extract last 60 days of returns
Compute covariance matrix: Σ = cov(returns) × 252
Calculate true portfolio vol: σ_p = sqrt(w' × Σ × w)
w is the base weight vector from Step 1
This accounts for correlations between assets (not just individual volatilities)

Step 3: Leverage Scaling

Compute leverage multiplier: L = 0.10 / σ_p
Scale all weights: final_weight = base_weight × L
Shift forward 1 day to avoid look-ahead bias
Final weights can exceed 1.0 (leverage) or be fractional (de-leverage)
